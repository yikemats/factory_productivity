# [Factory Geek Journalist's Aerial Comparison: Tesla vs. Toyota's Latest Factories](https://yikemats.github.io/factory_productivity/)

## About this project
This is my fourth project for [the Lede Program](https://ledeprogram.com) at Columbia University. You can read the story here: [https://yikemats.github.io/factory_productivity/](https://yikemats.github.io/factory_productivity/)

In three of my previous projects, I either extracted, scraped, or analyzed data sets to extend the data gathering/analysis skills I learned in the course. But I didn't do any of these for this project.

As a Japanese journalist working for a business magazine publisher, I had been watching the Automotive industry for decades. And I fear or feel anxiety about the future of Japan's economy where the Auto industry is the largest driver.

The reason is......the rise of Tesla.

But don't get me wrong. I am not opposing or trying to do anything about it, rather, I am so excited about how Tesla is destroying the industry where, since the 1980s or 1990s, Japanese companies had been playing the dominant role.

Not only through interviewing factory workers and managers I grew my enthusiasm toward factories while I played at the small factory my father owned in my childhood. Factories are my home where I can relax and be excited at the same time.

Now I am based in New York and cover the US news, and I always wanted to see inside [Giga Texas](https://www.tesla.com/giga-texas), Tesla built and started production in April 2022. I never had a chance to go inside it, but at least I can analyze how fast it was for them to construct the second-largest building by volume in the world after the Boeing Everett Factory.

## Data Collection and Analysis:

I used my knowledge of the Toyota Production System and Kaizen practices using satellite photos from Google Earth.
